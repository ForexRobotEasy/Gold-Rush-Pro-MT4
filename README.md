# Gold Rush Pro MT4

This code represents a trading algorithm for the Gold Rush Pro MT4 platform developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please visit MQL5.

## Code Explanation

The code begins by including the necessary libraries and classes for trading, specifically the `Trade` library, `Order` class, and `Position` class.

Next, several trading functions are defined:

1. `PlaceOrder`: This function is used to place a new order with a specified volume, type, and price.
2. `ModifyOrder`: This function is used to modify an existing order with a specified ticket and price.
3. `CloseOrder`: This function is used to close an existing order with a specified ticket.

The code then implements real-time market data updates using the `OnTick` function. It retrieves the current market price using the `MarketInfo` function and updates the user interface with the latest market price using the `RefreshMarketPrice` function.

The code also includes functions for ensuring secure and reliable data transmission and storage (`IsDataSecure`), developing an intuitive user interface (`InitializeUI`), optimizing the performance and speed of the platform (`OptimizePerformance`), implementing risk management features (`RiskManagement`), and providing a comprehensive reporting system (`GenerateReports`).

Finally, the `OnStart` function serves as the main entry point of the program. It initializes the Gold Rush Pro MT4 platform by calling the `InitializeUI` function, starts real-time market data updates using `EventSetTimer`, executes trading logic by placing, modifying, and closing orders, optimizes the platform's performance, implements risk management features, and generates trading activity reports.
